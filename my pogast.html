            <h3>Determination</h3>
            <p>For turning a dream into reality the first thing that you need is determination. This will help you in a lot of ways. Firstly, it will help you decide the course of action for doing anything. Besides, it will also help you to plan the journey ahead. Also, it will help to take things slow and maintain a steady pace towards the dream.</p>

        <h3>It doesn’t always work like that.</h3>
        <p>When I’m writing, there’s often a moment when I start to panic because there’s so much I want to include: so many scenes going on simultaneously in my head. There are all these moments I want to bring to the reader, but there doesn’t seem to be any kind of sequential order to them. They all seem to coexist.</p>
